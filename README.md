## Introduction
 The motto of this project is to familiarise with ROS and Create the map in a certain environment and autonomously move the Robot (Turtle bot 2) to the desired location in the map where we have to scan the QR code and the detect the text. 
 
 This project is tested with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and ROS KINETIC. The hardware we are using is a Turtle Bot 2 with a Kobuki base as our robotic hardware platform with Kinect 1 which is a RGB-D sensor. We are using ROS as a software framework.
